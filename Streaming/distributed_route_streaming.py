 Counts words in UTF8 encoded, '\n' delimited text directly received from Kafka in every 2 seconds.
 Usage: direct_kafka_wordcount.py <broker_list> <topic>

 To run this on your local machine, you need to setup Kafka and create a producer first, see
 http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart

 and then run the example
    `$ bin/spark-submit --jars \
      external/kafka-assembly/target/scala-*/spark-streaming-kafka-assembly-*.jar \
      examples/src/main/python/streaming/distributed_route_streaming.py \
      localhost:9092 test`
